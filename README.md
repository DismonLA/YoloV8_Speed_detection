# YoloV8_Speed_detection
This project is my undergraduate thesis dedicated to vehicle speed detection using YOLOv8 and computer vision techniques. The system is designed to process video recordings, detect vehicles and calculate their speed based on the analysis of the frames obtained from the video recorder of the driving car.

Technologies used
Python
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
OpenCV (Computer Vision)
NumPy & Pandas (data processing)
Matplotlib (visualization)
Git & GitHub (version control)
Features
Vehicle detection with YOLOv8
Speed calculation based on frame-by-frame analysis
Real-time processing (when running on GPU)
Video recording and analysis
Data logging of detected vehicles and speeds
