# YoloV8_Speed_detection
This project is my bachelor's thesis, dedicated to the determination of car speed using YOLOv8 and computer vision methods. The system is designed to process video recordings, detect road infrastructure elements and calculate a moving car's speed based on frame-by-frame data analysis from a video recorder camera.

Technologies used:
Python
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics).
OpenCV (Computer Vision).
NumPy & Pandas (data processing).
Matplotlib (visualization).
Git & GitHub (version control).

Features:
Vehicle detection with YOLOv8.
Speed calculation based on frame-by-frame analysis.
Real-time processing (when running on GPU).
Video recording and analysis.
Data logging of detected vehicles and speeds.
Custom dataset creation for training the YOLOv8 model.
